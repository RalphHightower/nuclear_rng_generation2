Entropy = 7.998604 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 125000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 125000 samples is 241.57, and randomly
would exceed this value 71.76 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.6767 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.135794173 (error 0.18 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.002606 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
